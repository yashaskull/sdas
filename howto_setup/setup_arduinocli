The tutorial below pretty much explains how to setup the Arduino CLI.

Hope the link never stops working. :P

Remember:
1. Add user to dialout group
    sudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>
where username is your Linux user name.

2. Export $HOME before running Arduino CLI command when issued via startup script on boot. (example in rc.local)
    export HOME=/home/raspi
