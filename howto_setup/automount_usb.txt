How to automount a usb drive on RPi 3 B+ running Ubuntu Mate Ver. 16.04

This method uses fstab

1. Locate partition you want to mount:
  sudo fdisk -l
  
Look for: /dev/sda1 or /dev/sdb1 etc.

2. Locate the UUID (Universial Unique Identifier)
   sudo blkid
 
This will display every UUID for every storage device attached to the system.
Make note of the UUID of the usb drive you wish to mount.

3. Create mount point:
Mount point would typically be created in /media directory
  sudo mkdir /media/data
  
4. automount entry
  sudo nano /etc/fstab
  
Add a entry that looks like the entry below at the end of the fstab file:
  UUID=14D82C19D82BF81E /media/data    auto nosuid,nodev,nofail,x-gvfs-show 0 0
  
  Break down of entry:
  UUID=14D82C19D82BF81E - is the UUID of the drive. You don't have to use the UUID here. You could just use /dev/sdj, but it's always safer to use     the UUID as that will never change (whereas the device name could).
  
  /media/data - is the mount point for the device.
  
  auto - automatically mounts the partition at boot 
  
  nosuid - specifies that the filesystem cannot contain set userid files. This prevents root escalation and other security issues.
  
  nodev - specifies that the filesystem cannot contain special devices (to prevent access to random device hardware).
  
  nofail - removes the errorcheck.

  x-gvfs-show - show the mount option in the file manager. If this is on a GUI-less server, this option won't be necessary.
  
  0 - determines which filesystems need to be dumped (0 is the default).
  
  0 - determine the order in which filesystem checks are done at boot time (0 is the default).
  
5. Testing the entry:
    sudo mount -a
 
 If you see no errors, the fstab entry is correct and you are safe to reboot.
